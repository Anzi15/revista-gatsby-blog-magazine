We're currently developing a React-based (possibly interactive) format for Learning Path articles. We want users to easily determine the learning path for their desired goal. This can easily be written as an article, but we're brainstorming a way to make this more interactive and helpful for learners.

If you'd like to be a part of this planning and development, head over to our Github repo and discuss it with us!
