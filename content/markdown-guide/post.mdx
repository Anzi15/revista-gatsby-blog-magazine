## Images

Images are easy to use in Markdown.

![Stormtroopocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg 'The Stormtroopocat')
![Alt text goes here](./images/html-2.png)

```
![Stormtroopocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg "The Stormtroopocat")
![Alt text goes here](./images/html-2.png)

```

Note that although possible with special configuration, you currently cannot modify the size of in-article images. The current max width is 650px. Please size image files accordingly for the fastest build times!

## Blockquotes

IMPORTANT: If you don't see any styling here, we haven't decided on blockquote styling yet :)

> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>
> > ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> >
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.

## Lists

#### Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Very easy!
 

#### Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

###### Start numbering with offset:

158. foo
159. bar

```

## Code

Inline `code`

Block code "fences" 

```
Sample text here...
Can span multi lines
```

````

At the moment we have not implemented syntax highlighting, since there won't be many code blocks on the site. Except for Markdown!

## Tables

Currently, we do not use HTML tables, however we may implement styling for this is there is a use-case in the future.

### Footnotes

Footnote 1 link[^1].

Footnote 2 link[^2].

Duplicated footnote reference[^2].

**Footnotes will appear at bottom of this page.**

[^1]: Footnote **can have markdown**

    and multiple paragraphs.

[^2]: Footnote text.

```markdown
Footnote 1 link[^1].

Footnote 2 link[^2].

Duplicated footnote reference[^2].

**Footnotes will appear at bottom**

[^1]: Footnote **can have markup**

    and multiple paragraphs.

[^2]: Footnote text.
```

### Figcaptions

Markdown does not natively support figcaptions (at least not at the time of writing this). It's worth noting that you can write HTML directly in Markdown files, but we've found a way to simplify this process.

Instead of using figcaptions to caption images, we'll be using a little shortcut [found on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll). Simply place the image using markdown (as shown earlier), then place italicized text after using `*write caption here*` with the caption inside of it. When compiled to HTML, this will place `<em>` tags around the text, and using a CSS rule `img + em { }`, we turn this into a caption. For example,

![Features of Java](./images/html-2.png 'The Tea Company')
_Image from https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/java-introduction/_

```markdown
![Features of Java](./images/html-2.png 'The Tea Company')
_Image from https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/java-introduction/_
```

### See the footnotes below?

Remember when we wrote footnotes earlier? They automatically appear at the bottom! ⬇️
